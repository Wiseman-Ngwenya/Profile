                    Hey there! My name is Wiseman Ngwenya and I am a young and upcoming full stack web developer. 
                    In this website you shall find many things one of which is a list of some of the projects I have worked on and currently working on. 
                    Feel free to check some of them by <a href = "projects.html" class = "link">clicking here</a>. 
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class = "container">
                <h1 class = "center">Skills</h1>
                <p>
                    As a full stack web developer I have accomplished proficient skills in multiple languages. 
                    Some of the Languages I have mastered over time are listed below:
                    <ul class = "link"> <!-- Links to projects will be added later -->
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</<li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other useful languages I have grasped the critical basics of are:
                    <ul class = "link"> <!-- Links to projects will be added later -->

                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
        </main>
