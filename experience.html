        <p>    I have only 5 months of experience in multiple different languages and throughout these 5 months I have created countless hands on projects. 
        Some of these projects are listed on this website (<a href = "projects.html" class = "link">click here to view </a>).
        In these projects various languages have been used like python, html and css.
        At the moment I am currently learning more languages like C++, javascript, C#, etc and have successfully grapsed the basics of most these languges.

                In this very short time and experience in programing I have been able to land a few jobs while freelancing.
                Most of these jobs were debuging simple codes and the other were lecturing begginers in languages like python and HTML/CSS
